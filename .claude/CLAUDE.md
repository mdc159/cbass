# Claude Code Configuration

This directory contains Claude Code configuration for LSP-aware development.

## LSP Usage

When working with code, prefer LSP-based navigation:
- Use **go-to-definition** to jump to symbol definitions
- Use **find-references** to see all usages of a symbol
- Use **hover** to get type signatures and documentation

## Agents

See `.claude/agents/` for LSP-aware sub-agents.

## Skills

See `.claude/skills/` for reusable LSP patterns.

## Hooks

See `.claude/hooks/` for automated LSP-based checks.

Use GitHub code search to find real-world examples:

1. **Identify the concept** to search for
2. **Search GitHub** using gh_grep MCP for similar implementations
3. **Show code snippets** with explanations
4. **Explain how they work** in simple terms
5. **Suggest adaptations** for CBass

Example searches:
- n8n workflow patterns
- Docker Compose AI stacks
- Ollama integration examples
- Supabase authentication flows
- RAG implementation patterns
- Vector database usage

For each example found:
- Link to the source repository
- Explain the context and use case
- Highlight key techniques
- Discuss pros and cons
- Suggest how to adapt for this project
